## Save a note of the briefing to Obsidian, sync Google Calendar events to Todoist as tasks and all of it back to Obsidian ðŸ¦¾

## Why does this project exists?

I already have [personal-assistant-cli](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/personal-assistant-cli), but its main focus was AI and Todoist, not really Obsidian.

- This project is from Obsidian's point of view
- I wanted to use Python instead of bash
